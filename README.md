# Python_Set_Assignment
A comprehensive collection of practical exercises focused on mastering **Sets** in Python. This repository covers fundamental to intermediate set manipulations, including mathematical operations, state updates, and multi-set logic.

## 🚀 Overview

Sets are an essential data structure in Python, characterized by being unordered, unindexed, and containing only unique elements. This assignment demonstrates how to leverage built-in set methods to solve common data filtering and comparison problems.

## 📂 Contents

The assignment includes 10 progressive challenges:

1.  **Bulk Addition**: Merging a list into an existing set.
2.  **Intersection**: Identifying identical items across two sets.
3.  **Union**: Combining sets to extract all unique items.
4.  **Difference Update**: Modifying a set by removing overlaps.
5.  **Batch Removal**: Removing specific elements at once.
6.  **Symmetric Difference**: Finding items present in either set, but not both.
7.  **Disjoint Verification**: Checking for commonality and displaying shared items.
8.  **Symmetric Difference Update**: Updating a set to exclude shared items.
9.  **Intersection Update**: Filtering a set to keep only common items.
10. **The "Only-In-One" Challenge**: Advanced logic to find elements unique to their respective sets across three different data sources.

## 🛠️ Concepts Covered

The solutions utilize the following Python Set methods:
* `.update()` / `.difference_update()`
* `.union()` / `.intersection()`
* `.symmetric_difference()` / `.symmetric_difference_update()`
* `.isdisjoint()`
* `.intersection_update()`
